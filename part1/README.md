# Part 1 - Security within the development environment

In Part 1 we look at a variety of technologies that can be used to improve security in the SDLC at the development environment level.

A number of technologies are used during this part of the workshop including:

1. SonarLint: https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarcloud/improving/sonarlint/

2. VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. SonarCloud: https://sonarcloud.io/

4. GitHub: https://github.com/

5. Talisman: https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman

6. .gitignore files: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

7. BFG repo-cleaner: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ 

We have provided setup scripts for using the Codespace during the workshop. This avoids the issues with having to install packages locally on your laptop and battle configuration settings. You can also use VS Code with CodeSpaces, more info on this can be found here:

https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code

The first account you will need if you have not created it already is a GitHub one. You can create an account here: https://github.com

Once this created, you can now fork this repository.

## Codespaces Setup
Navigate to the Code tab in your forked repository.

Next, select the green Code button which will dispaly a drop down.

Select the Codespaces tab.

Select the Create codesapce on main button.

## Module 1: IDE Integration 

The first part of the workshop will cover security within the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

In this example we will add plugins to the IDE in order to detect security issues on the fly.

### SonarLint Plugin  

We will be using a plugin called SonarLint. SonarLint can be obtained from:

https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarcloud/improving/sonarlint/

Supported IDEs include:

1. JetBrains IDEs (IDEA, CLion, GoLand, WebStorm etc.)

2. Visual Studio 

3. VS Code 

4. Eclipse 

During this workshop we use VS Code within Codespace for examples.

SonarLint has a number of features including:

* Connects with SonarCloud 
* Rules and issues
* Quick Fixes
* Secrets Detection 
* Vulnerability detection 

Download and install the plugin into your Codespace IDE before proceeding. 

For this demo we also optionally recommend creating a SonarCloud account. You can do this via your GitHub user at:

https://sonarcloud.io/

SonarLint will still work without a SonarCloud account, but has fewer features. 

If you create a SonarCloud account, once you have an account, make a note of your `Organization` name from the `Organizations` tab in SonarCloud.

Next generate a token. Go to the `Security` tab and generate a new token, call it `dev-sec-ops-demo`.

In your IDE, select the `Add SonarCloud Connection` option. On this screen you can add the token, and `Organization Key`.

Using SonarLint we can now detect security issues in the code base.

Open up the `vuln.ini` in the `part1` folder in your IDE. 

![Part 1 - SonarLint](./img/sonarlint.png "SonarLint example")

You should see that under the `aws_key_id` key id value is a wavy line. If you hover over this, or select the `PROBLEMS` tab, an error should be present:

```console

Make sure the access granted with this AWS access key ID is restricted

``` 

This indicates that SonarLint has picked up on the key being hardcoded into the file.

Let's now look at some of the other findings in the JS file:

* Use of `var` instead of `let` or `const`
* Useless variable assignments (note also the use of the local DB)
* Inclusion of an `alert` which could leak sensitive information
* Use of the `debugger` statement, which SonarLint flags for security concerns 

If you select the example `var sqlresult` where `var` being used a small lightbulb will appear, clicking this will allow you to quickly fix the issue.

Try this and you will see it replaced the `var` with `let` and removes the detected issue. We're going to leave the other issues in place now, so we can demonstrate how to fix them using some of the other tools in this workshop. 

That wraps up using SonarLint. You can use it to quickly detect parts of your codebase that may have syntax errors, styling problems, and a subset of security issues.

Let's take a look at an alernative tool to SonarLint which can also detect issues in the codebase. 

### CodeQL - Demonstration 

We're now going to switch over to using another tool that can aid in detecting security issues in our source code. This tool is called CodeQL.

For the purposes of the workshop, we will demo and walk through this within the provided GitHub Codespace. Note: This setup is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production environments or personal projects during the workshop.


#### Post-workshop Codespace Workspace setup

For those interested in exploring CodeQL further after the workshop, you can refer to the official CodeQL documentation for detailed installation and setup instructions. Please note that the CodeQL setup provided here is meant solely for demonstration within this workshop.


We have provided example scripts you can use to generate a CodeQL database in your Codespace. First install the commandline:

```
sudo bash ./codeqlinstall script
```

Next generate the database:

```
sudo bash ./codeqldb.sh
```

After you have run this we can fork the `vscode-codeql-starter` repository and run CodeQL as a Codespace from here.

Navigate to https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql-starter

Fork a copy of this repository. Then once forked, create a CodeSpace from the `main` branch.

Inside of the VS Code IDE in the left hand menu open the `Extensions` panel.

In the `Search Extensions in Marketplace` field, enter `CodeQL`

Click `Install` next to the `CodeQL` option.

You are now ready to experiment with the queries.

#### Working with queries

In the left-hand menu you should now see a list of queries.

![Part 1 - CodeQL](./img/codeql.png "CodeQL example")

Scroll down and select the `example.ql` from under the `codeql-custom-queries-javascript` to see an example of a CodeQL query.

This demonstrates the format that CodeQL queries are written in. If you scroll down further to the `ql` folder and expand it you'll see a section called `javascript`.

Under this folder you will find the configuration of JavaScript queries for detecting issues with the code base.

Once the plugin is installed you can open our your DB via the `Databases` menu, but scrolling down it e.g. `From a URL (as a zip file)`

We are going to use an example of a pre-built database we created using the example script previously.

You can filter the queries in the `QUERIES` panel to only display JavaScript ones, by selecting `JavaScript` from the `LANGUAGE` panel. This should make the query list easier to navigate.

From the `QUERIES` list navigate down to find `javascript / ql > src > LanguageFeatures > DebuggerStatement.ql`. A triangle will appear. This is the run icon, which will execute the query against the database. Click this.

CodeQL will now run the query against our source code. It might take a few seconds to compile, optomize and execute. You should now see it finds the `debugger` statement in the source code.

![Part 1 - CodeQL Query Example](./img/codeqldebugger.png "CodeQL Debugger  example")

CodeQL has a huge number of queries available for JavaScript. You can scroll through the list and try running some of them to see what you can find. 

That wraps up the basics of using CodeQL to build a database of our code, and manually run scans against it to find issues. When we move on to Part 2 you will see CodeQL in action within GitHub Advanced Security, where it provides SAST support. 

### GitHub Copilot (optional hands on)

For those of you with student accounts or paid GitHub accounts you can integrate Copilot into your IDE and use the power of GenerativeAI to detect and remediate issues.  

Copilot is GitHub's new tool to integrate GenAI into the development process allowing you to generate code and unit tests on the fly. It can also be used to help detect security vulnerablities in source code.

To register for a plan refer to:

https://github.com/features/copilot/plans

A quick start guide is provided here: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart

For this course, we are interested in installing the Copilot extension in VS Code within Codespace.

1. Install the plugin from the marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot

2. If prompted, open VS Code

3. Under the `Extension: GitHub Copilot` tab, select `Install`

4. You will now be prompted to grant permissions to authorize Copilot.

With Copilot installed you can follow along with the steps below.

1. Open the Chat Window

2. Enter the following prompt "Can you highlight security issues in my code?"
 
3. Co-pilot will execute your query and spit out a response similar to the following:

```console 

SQL Injection: In the saveToDatabase method, you're directly inserting the blogPost properties into the SQL query. This makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

```
```javascript
static saveToDatabase(blogPost) {
        const sql = `INSERT INTO blog_posts (title, content, author) VALUES ('${blogPost.title}', '${blogPost.content}', '${blogPost.author}')`;
    }
```

4. We can now ask it how to remediate this issue by asking "How can I prevent SQL injection in my code?"

Co-pilot will now spit out an example of how the code can be refactored.


```console
To prevent SQL injection, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures that user input is always treated as literal data and not part of the SQL command. Here's how you can modify your saveToDatabase method to use parameterized queries:
```

```javascript
    static saveToDatabase(blogPost) {
        const sql = `INSERT INTO blog_posts (title, content, author) VALUES (?, ?, ?)`;
        // Pretend database call
        console.log(`Executing SQL: ${sql}`);
        var db = window.openDatabase("sqlcachedb", "1.0", "Cache result", 200000);
        db.transaction(function(tx){
            tx.executeSql(sql, [blogPost.title, blogPost.content, blogPost.author], function(tx, results){
                console.log("Data inserted successfully");
            }, function(tx, error){
                console.log("Error occurred while inserting data");
            });
        });
    }
```

```console
In this code, the ? are placeholders for the actual values. The values are passed in as an array in the second argument to executeSql. This ensures that the values are properly escaped, preventing SQL injection attacks.
```

Much like we did with SonarLint, we can fix issues by selecting the wavy lines and clicking the small icon that pops up. Select the line with the `var db = window.openDatabase` issue.

From the menu, select the `Fix using Copilot. 

You'll now be presented with an option to replace `var` with `let` like we did in the previous example. Select this and save your change.

Using these mechanism we can have Copilot present us with a set of fixes for the issues it detected, as well as the problems that SonarLint and CodeQL highlighted.

So in addition to detecting and fixing issues from the IDE, what else can we do to harden our development process?

## Module 2: Pre-commit Hooks 

Having demonstrated how we can fix security issues as we go, we next look at mechanisms to prevent code with vulnerabilities, such as hard coded secrets being commited 
to the repository. To do this we will show you how to use pre-commit hooks.

### Talisman 

The next tool we will look at is Talisman which can be used to setup pre-commit hooks to aid in security. 

You can find it at the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman

Talisman is capable of scanning git changesets to ensure secrets and other sensitive information is
not added to the repository. This includes not only AWS API Keys, but SSH keys, tokens, passwords and similar.

Install in the code space by entering:

```console
bash -c "$(curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtworks/talisman/main/install.sh)"
```

Open up the `README` file in the GitHub repository and follow the installation steps for your OS.

Once installed we can configure a stand alone pre-commit hook for our repository.

Run the following command:

```console
echo "talisman -g pre-commit" >> .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

The pre-commit hook will now act as a blocker to commiting secrets to the code base.

We can ignore false positives using the `.talismanrc` file. You can see an example in the root of this project. 

Here we have told it to ignore the `README` file, since it contains words that trigger a false positive.

```console
Talisman Scan: 3 / 3 <-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 100.00%  

Talisman Report:
+-----------------+--------------------------------+----------+
|      FILE       |             ERRORS             | SEVERITY |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| part1/README.md | Potential secret pattern :     | low      |
|                 | not added to the repository.   |          |
|                 | This includes not only AWS API |          |
|                 | Keys, but SSH keys, tokens,    |          |
|                 | passwords and similar.         |          |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+----------+


If you are absolutely sure that you want to ignore the above files from talisman detectors, consider pasting the following format in .talismanrc file in the project root

fileignoreconfig:
- filename: part1/README.md
  checksum: 7bc8a740923be465f9f54f83fef533d0e93fa2b978350fc006d2094f2d47741d
version: ""

```

We can also ignore low severity findings, by adding the following line to our .talismanrc

```YAML

threshold: medium

```

Of course, this introduces the risk that true positives could be added to the code base. 

Talisman can also be run as a command line tool. This will scan the target directory for secrets and output a JSON file with a list of findings.

To run a scan you can type:

```console

talisman -s

``` 

The output will be added to:

```console

talisman_report/talisman_reports/data

```


Give this a try and navigate to the folder. Open the JSON file in your IDE to examine it. 


## Module 3: Preventing accidental commits


We've seen a couple of methods to catch secrets from being commited to the repository. We can also prevent whole files being added. 

Much as we saw with the `.talismanrc` file where we could configure talisman to ignore false positives, we can use a `.` file to prevent whole file types being commited to git.

To do this, we use the `.gitignore` file. Our next task will be to demonstrate how they work.

### .gitignore files 

Within the repository we have provided an example ignore file called `example.gitignore`.

Rename the `example.gitignore` file in the root of this directory to `.gitignore`.

Now try copying the `vuln.ini` file as a `.env` file.

```console
cp vuln.ini .env
```

Now run:

```console
git status
```

You should see the `.env` file isn't present e.g. 

```console
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
```

This is because the `.gitignore` file is preventing this file type from being added. 


If you edit the `.gitignore` file to remove the `.env` line, then run `git status` again, it will be listed e.g.


```console
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.env
	.gitignore
```

As you can see this simple technique can be used to block production configuration files with secrets located in them from being commited and pushed to GitHub, thus exposing them.

We can also use this technique to prevent binary files, PDFs or other file types that are undesirable being commited to the repository.

So what happens if we have already commited a file, or somebody not following best practices adds one? Well there are techniques we can use to clean it up.

Let's look at an example.


### BFG to clean up accidental commits

In some cases a file may already exist in the commit history that we need to remove. This could have been due to a disabled pre-commit hook, a file or pattern that wasn't caught, or a file added prior to the introduction of DevSecOps processes.

In order to clean up historical commits we can use BFG. Let's try an experiment to demonstrate this. 

The BFG Repo cleaner tool is pre-installed into the workspaces dev container. It can be accessed from java -jar /usr/local/bin/bfg

The `bfg` command used later in this example is an alias for calling the BFG .jar file:

```console

java -jar /usr/local/bin/bfg

```

You can add an alias to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:

```console

alias bfg='java -jar /usr/local/bin/bfg'
```

Or if you want, replace the `bfg` references below with the direct call to the `.jar` file shown above. 

With BFG setup, we can now try and experiment.

We previously modified our `.gitignore` file so that we can now commit the `.env` file which contains secrets. 

We are now going to demonstrate how a mistake can happen that needs to be cleaned up. Add and commit this modified `.gitignore` file now:

```console
git commit -m"Adding the .env file so we can demonstrate BFG"
```


Now push this commit to your fork.

```console
git push
```

We should now see the `.env` file is present, along with all the leaked secrets!

When a mistake like this happens in real life there are two steps we would want to take:

1. Remove the secrets from the repository

2. Rotate them so they are now obsolete

Let's now use BFG to scrub the file from the repository:

```console
bfg --delete-files .env my-forked-repo.git
```

BFG will now remove the `.env` file we added.

We can check this was successful by checking the log:

```console
git log

git show HEAD
```

Once you are happy the file is cleared, go ahead and push the changes back to your fork:

```console
git push
```

So we just saw a simple approach to doing file clean up!


## Conclusion

You've now completed Part 1. Here we setup our development environment and accounts and we learned about:

1. IDE plugins to detect secutity issues

2. Pre-commit hooks to prevent adding passwords and API keys to GitHub

3. Using .gitignore files to bock whole file types being commited

4. A technique to clean up accidentally commited files

In Part2 we are now going to see how the next line of defense in the source control management system and CI/CD pipelines can perform similar and complementing tasks.
